- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m lndura.

I do simple lua coding for Ds3 Cheat Engine as a hobby.
I made an easy to use Cheat Table for Dark Souls III.
It's designed to be easy to use, very new user friendly and has no malicious items.
I am not responsible for how you use cheatengine or if you get banned for using it.

People that contributed to table stuff:
- everyone from The Grand Archives
- DiamondEnderman
- Falco
- Deivid
- Kujo
