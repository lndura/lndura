### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m lndura.

I do simple lua coding for Ds3 Cheat Engine as a hobby.
I made an easy to use Cheat Table for Dark Souls III.
It's designed to be easy to use, very new user friendly and has no malicious items. 

I am not responsible for how you use cheatengine and wether you get banned for using it.
